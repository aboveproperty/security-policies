### Policies and Controls Framework

{{companyShortName}} maintains a set of policies and controls that captures
standards, regulatory, legal, and statutory requirements relevant to the
business needs. The framework and its contents are reviewed at least annually to
ensure changes that could affect the business processes are reflected.

#### Structure

Similar to the concept of "micro-services", the policies and control procedures
are written in individual "micro-docs".  They are mapped to each other via a
JSON configuration.

#### Controls Mapping

A JSON document configures the mapping of each control procedure to one or more
security/compliance frameworks, as applicable.

Note that the controls mapping is only between a control/procedure document to
the requirement, not at the policy level. This is because we strongly believe
that you must have documented controls and procedures to implement and enforce a
high level written policy. Having a written policy by itself without 
implementation or enforcement does not address the risk of any security
or compliance requirement.

#### Compliance standards

At least once a year, {{companyShortName}} reviews the regulatory, legal, and
statutory requirements relevant to its business needs and adopts any relevant
standards into its controls framework and governance program.

The list of applicable standards can be found it the same repository as the
policies and controls documentation and/or in the {{provider}} compliance
management application/platform.
