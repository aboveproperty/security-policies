### Physical Asset Inventory

{{companyShortName}} IT leverages a SaaS-based IT asset management system,
{{provider}}, to maintain inventory of all company
owned physical computing equipment, including but not limited to:

* servers
* workstations
* laptops
* printers
* networking equipment

Each record includes details of the physical device such as manufacturer, model
serial number as well as ownership details and location.

The movement of computing hardware and electronic media is maintained as part of
the records, including media re-use and ownership reassignment.

{{companyShortName}} IT manager is responsible for ensuring each physical asset is
entered into and an up-to-date record is maintained in the IT
asset management system.

All company-owned devices are subject to a complete data wipe if deemed necessary, such as in the 
case of device infection or re-purpose. This data wipe will be carried out by the IT manager. Such
a wipe would occur without access to or backup of the system.

Plausible deniability is maintained through the following procedure:

* When equipment is shipped the full disk encryption (Bitlocker, or other) key is disabled
* When equipment is unpacked a full disk wipe is performed without backup
* Upon completion full disk encryption master key is destroyed
* Latest version of approved operating system is reloaded and updates are performed
* Unit is entered back into corporate inventory
