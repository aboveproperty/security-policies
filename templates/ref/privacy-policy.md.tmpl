If you contact us or participate in a survey, contest, or promotion, we collect

**INFORMATION FROM THIRD-PARTY SERVICES.** If you choose to connect your
account on our Services to your account on another service, we may receive
information from the other service. For example, if you connect to Facebook or

language, email address and friend list. You may also choose to grant us access
to your personal information such as activity data or health data from other
services. You can stop sharing the information from the other services with us
by removing our access to each other service.

**INFORMATION PROVIDED BY OTHER INDIVIDUALS.** While using our Services,
individuals may provide information about another individual, or an authorized
user (such as an account administrator) creating an account on your behalf may
provide information about You. When one individual provides us with information
(including personal information) about another individual, we assume that the
individual has permission and authority to do so and to consent on behalf of
that individual to the collection and use of personal information as described
in this Privacy Policy. Please contact us immediately if you become aware of an
individual providing us with personal information about another individual
without being authorized to do so, and we will act consistently with this
Privacy Policy.

**PAYMENT AND CARD INFORMATION.** Some {{companyShortName}} Services
support payments and transactions with third parties. If you activate this
feature, you must provide certain information for identification and
verification, such as your name, billing address, credit, debit or other card
number, card expiration date and CVV code. This information is used solely to
check your financial qualifications and collect payment from you. We do not
store your payment information. We use a third-party service provider to manage
payment card processing. Note that third-party payment processors may retain
this information in accordance with their own privacy policies and terms. This
service provider is not permitted to store, retain or use information you
provide except for the sole purpose of credit card processing on our behalf.

### INFORMATION WE RECEIVE FROM YOUR USE OF OUR SERVICES

**USAGE AND DEVICE INFORMATION.** When you use our Services, we receive certain
usage data ("Usage and Device Information"). This includes information about
your interaction with the Services, for example, when you view or search

operating system, or mobile device information (including device and application
identifiers), the referring web page, pages visited, location (depending on the
permissions you have granted us), and cookie information.

**OTHER SPECIAL CATEGORIES OF PERSONAL DATA.** To the extent that
information we collect directly from you is sensitive personal data subject to the 
European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), we ask for your 
explicit consent to process such sensitive personal data. We obtain this consent 
separately when you take actions leading to our obtaining the data or grant us 
access to your activity data from another service. You can use your account 
settings or contact us to withdraw your consent at any time, including by stopping 
use of a feature, removing our access to a third-party service, requesting deletion 
your data or closing your account.  

**California Privacy Rights.** If you are a California user, you have certain 
rights with respect to the collection, use, transfer, and processing of you 
"personal information," as defined by the California Consumer Privacy Act 
("CCPA"). We reserve the right to limit these rights where permitted under 
applicable law, including where your identity cannot be reasonably verified 
or to the extent your rights adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others. 
To exercise any of the rights below, please contact us via the contact information 
below. Only you or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that 
you authorize to act on your behalf may make a verifiable consumer request 
related to your personal information. 

However, if we are acting as a service provider (a "Data Processor") processing
your personal information on behalf of a third party that has collected such
data from you, and such third party is the party that has the right to determine
the purposes for which it will process your personal information and the means
it will use to process your personal information (the "Data Controller"), then
such Data Controller has the legal obligation to ask for your explicit consent
to process your sensitive personal data (including health data), and we are not
responsible for obtaining such consent from you.  In such a scenario, the Data
Controller may have their own, separate policies regarding the use and
disclosure of your personal information, including any sensitive personal data
you provide to such Data Controller.  In such a scenario, this Privacy Policy
does not apply to, we cannot control the activities of, and we are not
responsible for the activities of the applicable Data Controller generally; this
Privacy Policy only applies to our processing of your personal information that
we, as a Data Processor, have been asked to process on behalf of the Data
applicable Data Controller.  We encourage you to review such Data Controller’s
privacy policy and/or contact the applicable Data Controller for more
information about the policies that apply to their use and disclosure of your
personal information, including any sensitive personal data.
